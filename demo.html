> Quandora markdown editor

The editor aim is to provide an easy to use markdown editor for both developers and regular users. It still remains a code source editor but it tries to give an apercu of the final HTML rendering while typing. For more demanding users there is also a live HTML preview available with scroll synchronization. 

Its primary goal is to write comments or small / medium documents. It is not especially designed to deal with large markdown documents.

The editor is implemented in pure javascript and it is based on the [Content Editable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable) browsers capability. 

## Dependencies

There are no dependencies for the core part of the editor. 
Only two optional dependencies are needed when using the preview and live preview feature:

* [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) - a Markdown parser which is needed to generate the HTML preview (only needed when using the preview feature)
* [MutationObserver.js](https://github.com/polymer/MutationObservers) - A Mutation Observers Polyfill which is needed for the live preview feature on IE9

## Requirements:
Any *evergreen* browser (i.e. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE10+). To work in IE 9 it requires the `MutationObserver.js` dependency.

## Features
* Markdown syntax highlighting and HTML apercu or hints when possible.
* Markdown syntax autocompletion.
* Live preview (requires marked.js dependency)
* Native spellcheck (uses the browser *content editable* capability).
* Copy / Paste and customizable drag / drop. 
* HTML pasted content is converted to markdown (not supported on IE).
* Fully configurable suggest / autocompletion support.
* Display a configurable alert when leaving the editor page which content was modified and not saved.
* Extensibility through custom actions.
* Minimal mode for inline editing (with no toolbar).
* Editor mode with a customizable toolbar (you can remove or add custom actions as you want).
* Full Page mode - maximize to the size of the browser client area.
* Customizable stylesheet for both toolbar and editor content.

**To be implemented**:
* Automatic reference-style management: keep link definitions and references in sync.
This will make possible to insert *human friendly* links by inserting link references and automatically manage the link definitions.

## Distribution files

The editor is distributed as one default css file and a javascript file that comes in 3 different flavors depending on your needs:

* Default CSS file: `src/editor.css`
* JS files:
  * `build/qed-all.js` - include the editor code and all dependencies (marked.js and MutationObserver.js).
  * `build/qed-core.js` - include the editor code and the MutationObserver.js dependency.
  * `build/qed.js`- include only the editor code. No dependencies are included.
  
The minified versions of these files are ending in `.min.js`.  
The `build/qed.min.js` file is about **57K** and gziped is about **15K**.

**Note**: Usually when using the markdown editor you will want to use the preview too - in that case it is better to define a custom stylesheet for the preview - otherwise you will end up with the browser defaults which are not very pretty.
We have an example of such a stylesheet in `demo/preview.css` that you can use - it is not the best one - but surely better than the browser defaults.

## Building 

To build the editor you need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). To install grunt and get started with, see http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

You need first to install the project build dependencies before running the build.  
Go to the project directory and run: (you should do this only the once to locally download dependencies)

```shell
npm install
```

Then to build simply run:

```shell
grunt
```

## Usage

To use the editor you should include in your HTML page the editor javascript file (which one depends on your needs) and a stylesheet to configure the editor and optionally a stylesheet for the preview.  
You can use the default stylesheets from `src/editor.css` and `demo/preview.css`.  
For the example below we will use the complete qed build (containing all the dependencies): `build/qed-all.min.js`.

### Including the required scripts and sylesheets

First you need to declare the editor and the stylesheets in your page.  
Put this in the page `head`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/editor.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/preview.css">
<script type='text/javascript' src='path/to/qed-all.min.js'></script>
```

### Attach the editor to a `textarea` element

The simplest method to use the editor is to attach it to an existing `textarea` element:

### More?

For more details look into the sources and in the `demo` directory.  

## Demos

###  Readme Page Demo

See this README in the editor [here](http://quandora.github.io/qed/demo.html).

The default toolbar theme and actions are used. The editor is opened in **full page** mode. 

**Note** that actions like insert link or insert image or any other actions can be customized. The insert image action is not available in the demo since it requires storage to upload images etc. But drag dropping images or inserting them through a nav-bar button is possible. You should just write a little bit of javascript code to enable and customize it.

Also, it is easy to define your own actions and add them to the toolbar. If you don't want a default action you just omit her when defining the toolbar.

### Suggest Feature demo

See the suggest feature at work [here](http://quandora.github.io/qed/suggest-demo.html).

The editor is using a *blue theme* fo the toolbar (look in the `head` for the style override) and it adds a simple **suggest** functionality.
When you type @{{LETTER}} the editor will try to suggest you countries starting with {{LETTER}}.

This example is using an internal array of countries.  
But you can also use **AJAX** to fetch the suggest matchings you want to display.

I will provide you soon an example on using ajax (through JQuery) for doing this.
