It still remainins a code source editor but it tries to give an apercu of the final HTML rendering while typing. For more demanding users there is also a live HTML preview available with scroll synchronization. \r\n\r\nIts primary goal is to write comments or small / medium documents. It is not especially designed to deal with large markdown documents.\r\n\r\nThe editor is implemented in pure javascript and it is based on the [Content Editable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_Editable) browsers capability. \r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are no dependencies for the core part of the editor. \r\nOnly two optional dependencies are needed when using the preview and live preview feature:\r\n\r\n* [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) - a Markdown parser which is needed to generate the HTML preview (only needed when using the preview feature)\r\n* [MutationObserver.js](https://github.com/polymer/MutationObservers) - A Mutation Observers Polyfill which is needed for the live preview feature on IE9\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\nAny *evergreen* browser (i.e. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE10+). To work in IE 9 it requires the `MutationObserver.js` dependency.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* Markdown syntax highlighting and HTML apercu or hints when possible.\r\n* Markdown syntax autocompletion.\r\n* Live preview (requires marked.js dependency)\r\n* Native spellcheck (uses the browser *content editable* capability).\r\n* Copy / Paste and customizable drag / drop. \r\n* HTML pasted content is converted to markdown (not supported on IE).\r\n* Fully configurable suggest / autocompletion support.\r\n* Display a configurable alert when leaving the editor page which content was modified and not saved.\r\n* Extensibility through custom actions.\r\n* Minimal mode for inline editing (with no toolbar).\r\n* Editor mode with a customizable toolbar (you can remove or add custom actions as you want).\r\n* Full Page mode - maximize to the size of the browser client area.\r\n* Customizable stylesheet for both toolbar and editor content.\r\n\r\n**To be implemented**:\r\n* Automatic reference-style management: keep link definitions and references in sync.\r\nThis will make possible to insert *human friendly* links by inserting link references and automatically manage the link definitions.\r\n\r\n## Distribution files\r\n\r\nThe editor is distributed as one default css file and a javascript file that comes in 3 different flavors depending on your needs:\r\n\r\n* Default CSS file: `src/editor.css`\r\n* JS files:\r\n  * `build/qed-all.js` - include the editor code and all dependencies (marked.js and MutationObserver.js).\r\n  * `build/qed-core.js` - include the editor code and the MutationObserver.js dependency.\r\n  * `build/qed.js`- include only the editor code. No dependencies are included.\r\n  \r\nThe minified versions of these files are ending in `.min.js`.  \r\nThe `build/qed.min.js` file is about **57K** and gziped is about **15K**.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Usually when using the markdown editor you will want to use the preview too - in that case it is better to define a custom stylesheet for the preview - oherwise you will end up with the browser defaults which are not very pretty.\r\nWe have an example of such a stylesheet in `demo/preview.css` that you can use - it is not the best one - but surely better than the browser defaults.\r\n\r\n## Building \r\n\r\nTo build the editor you need [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). To install grunt and get started with, see http://gruntjs.com/getting-started\r\n\r\nYou need first to install the project build dependencies before running the build.  \r\nGo to the project directory and run: (you should do this only the once to locally download dependencies)\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen to build simply run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngrunt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo use the editor you should include in your HTML page the editor javascript file (which one depends on your needs) and a styleshhet to configure the editor and optionally a stylesheet for the preview.  \r\nYou can use the default stylesheets from `src/editor.css` and `demo/preview.css`.  \r\nFor the example below we will use the complete qed build (containing all the dependencies): `build/qed-all.min.js`.\r\n\r\n### Including the required scripts and sylesheets\r\n\r\nFirst uou need to declare the editor and the stylesheets in your page.  \r\nPut this in the page `head`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/editor.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/preview.css\">\r\n<script type='text/javascript' src='path/to/qed-all.min.js'></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Attach the editor to a `textarea` element\r\n\r\nThe simplest method to use the editor is to attach it to an existing `textarea` element:\r\n\r\n### More?\r\n\r\nFor more details look into the sources and in the `demo` directory.  \r\n\r\n## Demos\r\n\r\n* See this README in the editor [here](http://quandora.github.io/qed/demo.html).\r\n* See the suggestion feature at work [here](http://quandora.github.io/qed/suggestion-demo.html).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
